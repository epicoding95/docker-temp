1. Create Dockerfile
2. get the base image.. something like node
3.  setup the working directory and copy whatever is needed over to docker
4. .dockerignore file with node modules and whatever else
5. build the image with docker build -t (name) . the period is for the current working directory
6. run the image with something like  docker run -v ${pwd}\src:/app/src:ro -d -p 3000:3000 --name react-app react-image
      - this is for dev and will keep the docker container in sync with the local file system with bind mounts
      - the :ro makes it read only so the container can only read the data being sent
7. env variables can be used with the --env-file flag and then the path name to the .env file
8. when changing something in the docker file after the image has been created and using docker-compose you have to re run the build with docker-compose up -d --build
9. when seperating docker files for dev/prod and need to run a docker build you have to pass the -f flag and give it the file path to the docker file as well as in the docker compose file
